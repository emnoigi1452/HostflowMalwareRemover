# HostflowMalwareRemover
A command line tool to detect &amp; remove "hostflow" malware from infected minecraft plugins.

## Installation
Download it and drop it on your server root folder (where files like **bukkit.yml/spigot.yml** are located).

## Usage

```
Start your server with HostflowMalwareRemover.jar

- java -jar HostflowMalwareRemover.jar

If you use some panel you will have to select custom server version and then select this jar.
```

For Pterodactyl users, you can swap out the startup command with this for a quick removal
```
java -D"remover=true" -jar HostflowMalwareRemover.jar
```
Then, reinsert your server's startup command and start the server back up once you're done
If your panel has auto-restart, feel free to force-kill the server once you see the "Done!" message pop up


All malware plugins will be moved to `plugins/malware-quarantine`.

**NOTE:** It might break some plugins that use the actual [Javassist](https://github.com/jboss-javassist/javassist) library,
if it does you should download again that plugin from official sources.

**P/S:** It shouldn't break the [Javassist](https://github.com/jboss-javassist/javassist) library if the library is encased.
